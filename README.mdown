[Molecules](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/molecules/id284943090?mt=8) is an outstanding iPad app created by Brad Larson of [Sunset Lake
Software](http://sunsetlakesoftware.com). As of this writing, the app is
available for free in the iTunes App Store.

The author has made the source code available under the BSD license. I
have added it to GitHub to make version control easier.

Thank you Brad Larson for this great open source contribution!
